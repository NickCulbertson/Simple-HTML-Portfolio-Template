## Implementation

1. Download the "portfolio" folder. Here you will find index.html, image-example.html, text-example.html, style.css, and an image and video folder.

index.html - The page people will see when they visit `http://www.YOUR_WEBSITE_NAME.com`

image-example.html & text-example.html - Starting point for pages off of the index page.

style.css - The styles for the site.

img - This is where all the art is stored.

2. Open the index.html in a code editor and update it with all your information.

3. Add the files to your site's root directory. Now your page is available at
`http://www.YOUR_WEBSITE_NAME.com`

4. Share the link and do the happy dance!
<!-- 
## Optional Features

By default, the cover image will be square. If you want a rectangular cover image, you can change height and width values of `.coverArt` and `.coverDiv` (height of container) in the `style.css` file:
```
style.css

.coverArt {
    ...
    max-height:  320px;
    max-width:   320px;
    ...
}

.coverDiv {
    height: 320px;
}
```

Delete this line to remove the image corner rounding:

```
style.css

.coverArt {
    ...
    border-radius: 160px 160px 160px 160px;
    ...
}
```

Make multiple sections like this:

```
index.html

...

<h1>Section 1 Title</h1>
<p>A brief description.</p>
    

<h1>Section 2 Title</h1>
<p>A brief description.</p>
...
```

## About This Project

Simple HTML Portfolio Template is an Open Source project to create an easy site for your work. No fluff or unnecessary code bloat. It's minimal and built to be easily customized and maintained. Watch the tutorial video for a quick explanation on what does what.
            
I'm making this template Open Source because I want to empower creatives to support themselves. I hope it helps make your first impression for your followers most triumphant!
