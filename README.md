## Implementation

1. Download the "now" folder. Here you will find now.html, now.css, and an image folder.

now.html - The page people will see when they visit `http://www.YOUR_WEBSITE_NAME.com/now`

now.css - The styles for this page.

img - This is where all the Cover art for the page and social badges are stored.

2. Open the now.html in a code editor and update it with all your information.

3. Adding your cover artwork by replacing the "cover.png" file in the img folder.

4. Add the entire files to your site's root directory. Now your page is available at
`http://www.YOUR_WEBSITE_NAME.com/now`

5. Share the link and do the happy dance!

## Optional Features

By default, the cover image will be square. If you want a rectangular cover image, you can change height and width values of `.coverArt` and `.coverDiv` (height of container) in the `now.css` file:
```
now.css

.coverArt {
    ...
    max-height:  320px;
    max-width:   320px;
    ...
}

.coverDiv {
    height: 320px;
}
```

Delete this line to remove the image corner rounding:

```
now.css

.coverArt {
    ...
    border-radius: 160px 160px 160px 160px;
    ...
}
```

Make multiple sections like this:

```
now.html

...

<h2>Section 1 Title</h2>
<p>A brief description.</p>
    

<h2>Section 2 Title</h2>
<p>A brief description.</p>
...
```

## About Simple HTML Portfolio Template

I was immediately drawn to the idea of creating a Now Page. At first, I just made another page off of my site but it was suffering from severe code bloat. So I made a stripped down version with only what was needed. I'm making this template Open Source because I want to empower creatives to support themselves. I hope it helps you to build a deeper connection with your followers! 

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback please send them my way. This is as much for me as it is for you. If you use it, send me a link! I'd love to see what you're up to now. 

Enjoy!
